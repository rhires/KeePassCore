# KeePassCore
KeePass .NET Core version 

Welcome to my humble repo. My primary goal is to convert this project fully to .NET Core to allow it to run on MacOS and Linux. 

My secondary goal is likely another project, in that I would like KeePass to be able to serve its UI in a web-based manner. 

Why? 

I've seen where people use KeePass on their local network on a local share, and share passwords in the not-most-secure way because it all runs as one user. 
A web-based interface would be easier to maintain, and it help to better differentiate users and keep passwords private, while at the same
time enabling multiple users to keep passwords in the same database.
